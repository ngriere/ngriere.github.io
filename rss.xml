&lt;p&gt;New to the software industry? Wondering what might make the difference between you and another developer in a few years? You’ve come to the right place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fellow software engineer that has worked for several companies and on various projects since I have joined the industry, these are a few thoughts I would like to share. These are things I have either reflected upon, experienced or observed during my short carreer so far. Some of the following might sound logical for you  -  excellent ! Nevertheless, I feel it is never enough to emphasize their importance. I decided to write this article because looking back, it is the kind of useful advices I wish I had read 5–7 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following tips will not help you ace an interview. Like many things in life, becoming a successful software developper takes time and patience. They should be things you apply and keep in mind on your route to getting there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Don’t aim to be a good programmer, aim to be a good software engineer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, I started this article without defining what an engineer actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I continue explaining this point, let me explain a little bit my background. I graduated from an engineering school in France and work in the Paris region. I don’t presume the terms &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer#Perception&quot;&gt;“engineer” or “developper” are universal&lt;/a&gt;. If you do search for job opportunities over here, you’ll find: “software engineer”, “software developper”, you might even encounter “software programmer” (yikes!). You’ll rarely find the term “coder” which sounds really bad in french. Sidenote, if you do see that kind of job offer run away ! Even among colleagues or friends, we don’t necessarily all use the same term. Some define themselves as developpers, others as engineers etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not give exhaustive definitions of these terms, these articles discuss thoroughly the difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/shakuro/programmer-vs-developer-vs-engineer-91ef374e5033&quot;&gt;Programmer Vs Developer Vs Engineer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuiltin.com%2Frecruiting%2Fsoftware-engineer-vs-programmer&quot;&gt;Software Engineer vs. Programmer: What’s the Difference?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will however say this: there is a clear distinction between those terms. I personally don’t make the distinction depending on an academic or job title. I will make one depending on a job description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An engineer will understand a business need and modelize the problem. He will be able to design and implement a solution along as tests that validate the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want to build good software, you can’t be “just coding”. There are many other steps involved in the development process. Coding probably takes 20 to 25% of your time. You should be able to take input from end users, discuss with your colleagues and product owner of the requirements, conceive a sotware architecture, define a technical stack. It is up to you whether you want to be involved in those critical decision-linked tasks. You may want to focus only on “coding”. I have two main objections to that: this is more error prone and I doubt you will be able to work in a mature, agile and self-organized team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Understand Agile, don’t just apply a process/framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, it it very rare to find people that have never worked or heard of agile methods. You’ve probably experienced working in a team that uses an agile method such as Scrum. But doing scrum by the book is not a measure of your team’s agility. As I matter of fact, I’ve seen very mature agile teams have quite different ceremonies and processes than the ones put forward by the Scrum methodology. On the other hand, some teams apply the method scrupulously but don’t achieve very good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/xT1XGOGdyDrL2BTfxK&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/siliconvalleyhbo-xT1XGOGdyDrL2BTfxK&quot;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why you need to put your practices in perspective, I once heard a very inspiring product owner say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scrum is to Agility what elections are to a democracy. Just as a country that holds elections is not necessarily a democracy, applying scrum does not guarantee your team is agile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your end goal should always be to strive for agility. At its root, agile is quite straight forward: 4 core values and 12 principles. Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilemanifesto.org&quot;&gt;agile manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, you should have a pretty good idea of how well your team is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of a framework such as Scrum if to help you on your way to becoming agile. That is why people are keen on applying agile methods. They aren’t an immediate solution, they are a tool.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of course, I am not telling you to throw away frameworks such as scrum. They will give you a process on your way to agility and do follow the rules strictly at first if you are learning &lt;strong&gt;(SHU)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are fully comfortable with the method, you can start adapting it to your own needs &lt;strong&gt;(HA)&lt;/strong&gt; and emancipating &lt;strong&gt;(RI)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Become a software crasftsman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be a worker, be a crafstman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design Patterns, Clean Code, Clean Architecture, OOP, Solid Principles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Don’t be a fashion victim / tech zealot&lt;/h2&gt;

        decoding=&quot;async&quot;
      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can be very enthusiast but avoid being fanatical about new frameworks and novelties in the tech industry. Sure they might be very trendy, extremely popular and bankable on your resume. If you are really interested in them, go ahead, work on them during your free time! However, in the workplace, the choice to work on a certain technology should always be motivated by its need and whether it is suited for your project context. You must keep that in mind when you are choosing your tech stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies to project guidelines or team practices. Don’t always take them for granted. Even though they might work well for your team and be suited to your size and type of project, they won’t always apply. It is very rare that you’ll encounter a undisputed absolute truth. If you do, I would argue it is not a project or team practice but recognised as a best practice or design pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to fashion or tv series, technology obey the same rules. You might be using the “next best thing” or the “hottest piece of tech” at the moment, these trends don’t last eternally and continuously renew themselves. Furthermore, some languages and tools might be appealing because there are brand new but the concepts or patterns they apply are not. This brings us to the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Understand underlying concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you want to master the languages and tools that you use. However, you should also focus on the broader concepts these tools are built on or use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following examples list areas you might want to explore if you are interested and use some associated technologies/examples that make use of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JVM environment (Java, Kotlin, Scala, Groovy etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection (Spring framework)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Containers  (Docker)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual DOM (React)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store (Redux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Component approach/ Web components (React, Vue, Polymer etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS, BEM (preprocessors SASS, SCSS, Less)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REST and SOAP architectures (JAX-RS, JAX-WS, expressjs etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenID Connect (OAuth 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript (ES6, ES2020, TypeScript etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of people have practiced TypeScript but many don’t fully understand JavaScript code mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really understand a concept you’ll have an undisputable head start regarding those who don’t. You’ll have a deeper understanding of the implementations of that concept and be able to transpose them into other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Get to the bottom of things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boy Scout Rule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always look for the root cause of a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t look for the hacky/short-term solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Broaden your knowledge / skillset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craftmanship: Clean Code, Clean Architecture, Solid principles, Design Patterns etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DevOps topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-functional knowledge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to learn - Flatten the learning curve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Be Humble &amp;#x26; patient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/5wWf7H89PisM6An8UAU&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/editingandlayout-the-office-michael-scott-5wWf7H89PisM6An8UAU&quot;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find yourself explaining something or sharing knowledge with a colleague, you should always remain humble and patient with your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good teachers aren’t the ones that explain the most complicated stuff. They are those who can make complicate and intricate concepts accessible for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something is hard to understand, you should be able to vulgarize and explain it to an audience. If you find that exercise difficult, you might want to question yourself on whether you truly understand what you are tying to explain. In the past, I have found myself in a situation where I believed I mastered something but explaining it to others was a real challenge. There shouldn’t be any shame in that, it simply means that maybe the extent to which I thought I understood a subject wasn’t as deep as I imagined it to be in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you should always adapt what you are saying to the person in front of you. You’ll definitely find yourself in situations where you believe someone or yourself to be a slow-learner. Remember where you come from and that no matter your age or experience, there will always be things that some will master quicker than others. We don’t all have the same areas of expertise, experience with the same subjects of same learning reflexes. Generally speaking, don’t blame the audience, question yourself on whether your approach is the best one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Make mistakes… again and again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:100%;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/67urFpVn7qwcd2gWIl&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/gifs/netflix-santa-clarita-diet-67urFpVn7qwcd2gWIl&quot;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&gt; You Miss 100% Of The Shots You Don&apos;t Take - Wayne Gretzky
&lt;p&gt;As half-canadian, this quote always was a motto for me. You’ve certainly heard it a hundred different ways. You don’t fail by trying, you fail by not trying. By trying, you may surpass yourself in ways you didn’t think possible. If you do end up failing, you’ll learn a lot from your mistakes. That’s a pretty good trade-off in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would even take this a step further and make a parallel with fail-fast designs: detect your mistakes as soon as possible. Detect and learn from them, they will pave the way for your future successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this might sound difficult especially if you are young and are debuting in a certain domain. You might lack a bit of self-confidence or be afraid of making mistakes. For example, you’re trusted to lead a critical feature or to test the integration of a certain framework on your project and give a presentation of your results to your team. This kind of responsibility can impress you at first. I will tell you this: the people that entrusted you with this mission know your potential, so trust yourself and take initiatives. The only regrets you’ll have is if you don’t try hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the main idea is this: get out of your comfort zone! Try new things, give your best and let your creativity flow. Taking risks will benefit you, one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Adapt continuously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When changes arrive in your work whether they are technical, organizational or human, you should accept them. Furthermore you should welcome change and look at it as a new opportunity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-retrospectives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these guidelines are deeply intertwained.
Generally speaking, work hard, be pragmattic, curious, get to the bottom of things, continuously assess yourself, have fun&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
